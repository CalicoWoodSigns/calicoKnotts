**Database Details:**

- Datasource Name: `calicoknottsdsn`
- Application: KBF Data Management System

**Tables Required:**

**Request:**
1. Please create a SQL Server 2019 database for my account
2. Set up a ColdFusion datasource named `calicoknottsdsn` pointing to this database
3. Provide the database connection details so I can run my table creation scripts

**Additional Information:**
- This is a business application for tracking employee sales data
- I have the SQL scripts ready to create the tables once the database is available
- My current application is working on another server and I'm migrating to this new hosting

Please let me know:

- Any connection details I need for running SQL scripts

Thank you for your assistance!
